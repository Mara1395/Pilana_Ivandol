## üìÑ Introduction

The Ivandol Sawmill website is a project aimed at showcasing the services, products, and information related to the Ivandol Sawmill. This is my first project that I made for a client. The website is designed and developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

### Through this project you can get information about:

- Information about the sawmill's services and products
- Photo galleries showcasing the sawmill's facilities and operations
- Contact form for users to get in touch with the sawmill
- Interactive elements powered by JavaScript to enhance user engagement
